## Internet of Things
Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical objects, equipped with technologies to communicate with each other and the environment. To help you understand, it is only a point in time when the number of gadgets connected to the World Wide Web has exceeded the number of people using the Internet. 

## Overview
The “Bitsy Bits” is an IoT composite project. This means it has all parts to implement the full user experience. At this moment, only the one component of the project has already implemented. It is a prototype of device arranged on the printed circuit board (PCB). The “Bitsy Bits” general device is designed in a such way to match the term "portable device". The current configuration is suitable for use it as wearable SmartWatch.
